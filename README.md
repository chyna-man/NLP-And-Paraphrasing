# 📄 Paraphrase Classification – Virtual Assistant (CSI5180 Assignment 2)

This repository contains the code, datasets, and report for an empirical study on paraphrase detection in the context of **Virtual Assistants**, completed as part of the **CSI5180 – Topics in AI** course at the University of Ottawa (Winter 2025).

## 🎯 Objectives

The purpose of this assignment is to explore the role and diversity of paraphrases in Natural Language Processing, especially for Virtual Assistant applications. Specifically, the project aims to:

- Analyze paraphrase variations and language diversity.
- Work with a real paraphrase dataset (**D1**).
- Build a simple **paraphrase classifier** using basic or advanced techniques.
- Generate a synthetic VA-specific paraphrase dataset (**D2**) using **Generative AI**.
- Evaluate classifier performance on both datasets (D1 and D2).
- Apply a **scientific methodology** to your experiments.
- Report findings in a **conference-style article**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `transformers` (for BERT, optional)
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub
- Datasets:
  - `D1`: Real paraphrase pairs
  - `D2`: Synthetic paraphrase pairs generated using a language model

## 🧪 Methodology

This assignment emphasizes scientific rigor over complex programming. Simpler methods (e.g., string similarity, token overlap) are acceptable, but those familiar with deeper ML techniques (e.g., BERT, sentence embeddings) are encouraged to use them.

Key elements:
- Data exploration & annotation
- Classifier design and testing
- Performance evaluation
- Comparison of real vs synthetic paraphrases
- Documenting insights and limitations
